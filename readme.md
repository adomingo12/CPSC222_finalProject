# Documenting My Life through Life Cycle
## Description
The purpose of this project was to summarize all the things that I learned during the fall semester in my Introduction to Data Science Class (CPSC222).
For this project, I chose my dataset from this app called Life Cycle. This app can be found in the app store. The app tracks all the locations I have
been in for the past five years, and sorts it into easy pie charts for the user to read. During my data science course, I learned how to use many different
libraries, such as pandas, numby, scipy, and scikit-learn. Through this project, you can get a better understanding of all the skills I have learned in this
class.
## How to Run Project?
The project is split into three main parts which is the Jupyter Notebook, the csv file, and the utility python file, which contains all of the functions
necessary for the project to fun. The Jupyter Notebook is the main part of the project that breaks down the project into multiple parts that are easy to 
understand. The csv file is the raw data that was gathered from the life cycle app. This file is cleaned and used in every aspect of this project.
## How Project is Organized?
The project is organized into six main parts which include:
* Background
  * Describes the data set used and how it is important to me
* Data Cleaning
  * Describe how the data was cleaned in order to continue with the rest of the parts of the assignment
* Visualization
  * To see the data, not in its raw form, but through graphs to give the user a better understanding of the data
* Hypothesis Testing
  * Trying to predict if I got more sleep during the summer, compared to the school year
* Classification
  * Seeing if machine learning could predict how and when I would do certain activities
* Conclusion
  * Summarizing my findings from this project and how I could continue with the assignment
